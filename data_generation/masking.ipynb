This means $r$ must be even. Step 8: Testing values of $r$, we find that $r=10$ satisfies the condition since $10-2=8$, which is divisible by 2.

      "  -> cand[6]: Solving for $x$, we get: $$x=\\frac{r-4}{2}$$ Step 5: Since $x$ must be an integer, $r$ must be even Step 6: Also, since $r$ must be at least 6 (because $x$ must be positive), we have: $$6\\le r\\le 98-4=94$$ Step 7: So, the possible values of $r$ are 6, 8, ..., 94 Step 8: For each value of $r$, calculate the corresponding value of $x$: $$x=\\frac{r-4}{2}$$ Step 9: Calculate the total number of band members for each pair $(r,x)$: $$m=rx+2$$ Step 10: Keep track of the maximum value of $m$ found Step 11: Repeat until all possible values of $r$ have been considered Step 12: Answer: The largest number of members the band could have is [MASKED]\n",

So, let's try $r=8$, which gives us $x=3$ Step 6: With $r=8$ and $x=3$, we have $rx+2=24+2=26$ and $(r-2)(x+1)=6*4=24$. Since $26>24$, this doesn't work. However, if we increase $r$ to 10, then $x=1$ and $rx+2=10*1+2=12$ and $(r-2)(x+1)=8*2=16$. This works! Step 7: Therefore, the largest possible number of band members is $rx+2=10*1+2=\\boxed{12}$\n",

Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98.  We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation.  If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big.  If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98.  Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\\cdot 7=98$ as it should.
